name: New Scaffolder request
about: Suggest a new scaffolder.

---

**Is there already a definition file for the scaffolder? (see https://github.com/log2timeline/L2tScaffolder/tree/master/l2tscaffolder/definitions).**
Yes/No

**If there isn't a definition, what is the link to the new project you want to add?**
URL to the project path

Keep in mind that if this isn't a l2t project, you may have to explain here the reasoning behind wanting to add this project here. The l2tscaffolder is meant for open source forensics tool development, so only accept feature requests for projects that fall into that category.

**What is required for this scaffolder to work?**
A clear and concise description of the files that need to be copied and what files need to be created and modified. That is a full relative path to all files that will be generated by the scaffolder.

**What questions are needed?*
A clear and concise description of any questions that need to be asked before files are generated, what needs to be asked in order for the scaffolder to generate files, eg. "a list question that contains all the required tables, a dict question listing all SQL commands the callback function for each returned row", etc.

**Do you have template files you can share?**
These would be the jinja2 template files, or just examples of a generated code that can be used to create the template files.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
